## OVERVIEW

In this Assignment, we move beyond the investigation of within-site $\alpha$-diversity.
We will explore $\beta$-diversity, which is defined as the diversity that occurs among sites.
This requires that we examine the compositional similarity of assemblages that vary in space or time.

After completing this exercise you will know how to:

1. formally quantify $\beta$-diversity
2. visualize $\beta$-diversity with heatmaps, cluster analysis, and ordination
3. test hypotheses about $\beta$-diversity using multivariate statistics

## Directions:
1. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
2. Complete as much of the exercise as possible during class; what you do not complete in class will need to be done on your own outside of class.
3. Use the Handout as a guide; it contains a more complete description of data sets along with the proper scripting needed to carry out the exercise.
4. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this exercise document; they also correspond to the Handout.

Your pull request should include this file *beta_assignment.Rmd* and the html output of `Knitr` (*beta_assignment.html*).

## 1) R SETUP

Typically, the first thing you will do in either an R script or an RMarkdown file is setup your environment. 
This includes things such as setting the working directory and loading any packages that you will need.

In the R code chunk below, provide the code to:  

1. clear your R environment,
2. print your current working directory,
3. set your working directory to your "*/Week3-Beta*" folder, and
4. load the `vegan` R package (be sure to install if needed).  

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
getwd()
#setwd("~ /Users/DELL/GitHub/QB2017_Ramesh/Week3-Beta")
library("vegan")

```

## 2) LOADING DATA
### Load dataset
In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. load the `doubs` dataset from the `ade4` package, and
2. explore the structure of the dataset.

```{r}
library("ade4")
dat <- data(doubs)
str(dat)
```

***Question 1***:  Describe some of the attributes of the `doubs` dataset.  

a.  How many objects are in `doubs`?
b.  How many fish species are there in the `doubs` dataset?
c.  How many sites are in the `doubs` dataset?

> ***Answer 1a***:  4
> ***Answer 1b***:  30
> ***Answer 1c***:  27

### Visualizing the Doubs River Dataset

***Question 2***: Answer the following questions based on the spatial patterns of richness (i.e., $\alpha$-diversity) and Brown Trout (*Salmo trutta*) abundance in the Doubs River.  

a.  How does fish richness vary along the sampled reach of the Doubs River?
b.  How does Brown Trout (*Salmo trutta*) abundance vary along the sampled reach of the Doubs River?
c.  What do these patterns say about the limitations of using richness when examining patterns of biodiversity?

> ***Answer 2a***:  Fish richness increases as one moves from upstream to downstream sites
> ***Answer 2b***:  Brown Trout abundance decreases as one moves from upstream to downstream sites
> ***Answer 2c***:  Species richness is simply a count of species, and it does not take into account the abundances of the species or their relative abundance distributions.

## 3) QUANTIFYING BETA-DIVERSITY

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. write a function (`beta.w()`) to calculate Whittaker's $\beta$-diversity (i.e., $\beta_{w}$) that accepts a site-by-species matrix with optional arguments to specify pairwise turnover between two sites, and
2. use this function to analyze various aspects of $\beta$-diversity in the Doubs River.  

```{r}
beta.w <- function(site.by.species = ""){
SbyS.pa <- decostand(site.by.species, method = "pa") # convert to presence-absence
S <- ncol(SbyS.pa[,which(colSums(SbyS.pa) > 0)]) # number of species in the region
a.bar <- mean(specnumber(SbyS.pa)) # average richness at each site
b.w <- round(S/a.bar, 3) # round to 3 decimal places
return(b.w)
}
beta.w <- function(site.by.species = "", sitenum1 = "", sitenum2 = "", pairwise = FALSE){
if (pairwise == TRUE){
# As a check, let's print an error if we do not provide needed arguments
if (sitenum1 == "" | sitenum2 == "") {
print("Error: please specify sites to compare")
return(NA)}
# If our function made it this far, let's calculate pairwise beta diversity
site1 = site.by.species[sitenum1,] # Select site 1
site2 = site.by.species[sitenum2,] # Select site 2
site1 = subset(site1, select = site1 > 0) # Removes absences
site2 = subset(site2, select = site2 > 0) # Removes absences
gamma = union(colnames(site1), colnames(site2)) # Gamma species pool
s = length(gamma) # Gamma richness
a.bar = mean(c(specnumber(site1), specnumber(site2))) # Mean sample richness
b.w = round(s/a.bar - 1, 3)
return(b.w)
}
else{
SbyS.pa <- decostand(site.by.species, method = "pa") # convert to presence-absence
S <- ncol(SbyS.pa[,which(colSums(SbyS.pa) > 0)]) # number of species in region
a.bar <- mean(specnumber(SbyS.pa)) # average richness at each site
b.w <- round(S/a.bar, 3)
return(b.w)
}
}

beta.w(doubs$fish,1,2,pairwise = TRUE) #0.5
beta.w(doubs$fish,1,10,pairwise = TRUE) #0.714
```

***Question 3***: Using your `beta.w()` function above, answer the following questions:

a.  Describe how local richness ($\alpha$) and turnover ($\beta$) contribute to regional ($\gamma$) fish diversity in the Doubs.
b.  Is the fish assemblage at site 1 more similar to the one at site 2 or site 10?
c.  Using your understanding of the equation $\beta_{w} = \gamma/\alpha$, how would your interpretation of $\beta$ change if we instead defined beta additively (i.e., $\beta = \gamma - \alpha$)?

> ***Answer 3a***:  According to Whittaker's Beta diversity, the regional fish diversity (gamma) is measured as the turnover between sites (Beta) times the local richness of a site (Alpha)
> ***Answer 3b***:  Site 1 and Site 2 are more similar (as Beta diversity is a measure of species dissimilarity)
> ***Answer 3c***:  Beta diversity in this form measures how many more species exist in the regional pool (gamma) when compared to the local pool (alpha)

### The Resemblance Matrix
In order to quantify $\beta$-diversity for more than two samples, we need to introduce a new primary ecological data structure: the **Resemblance Matrix**. 

***Question 4***: How do incidence- and abundance-based metrics differ in their treatment of rare species?

> ***Answer 4***:  

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. make a new object, `fish`, containing the fish abundance data for the Doubs River, 
2. remove any sites where no fish were observed (i.e., rows with sum of zero),
3. construct a resemblance matrix based on SÃ¸rensen's Similarity ("fish.ds"), and
4. construct a resemblance matrix based on Bray-Curtis Distance ("fish.db").  

```{r}
fish <- doubs$fish
fish <- fish[-8, ] # Remove site 8 from data

# Calculate Sørensen
fish.ds <- vegdist(fish, method = "bray", binary = TRUE)# This is the quantitabe 

# Calculate Bray-Curtis
fish.db <- vegdist(fish, method = "bray")
fish.db <- vegdist(fish, method = "bray", upper = TRUE, diag = TRUE)
fish.db

```

***Question 5***: Using the distance matrices from above, answer the following questions:

a. Does the resemblance matrix (`fish.db`) represent similarity or dissimilarity? What information in the resemblance matrix led you to arrive at your answer? 
b. Compare the resemblance matrices (`fish.db` or `fish.ds`) you just created. How does the choice of the Sorensen or Bray-Curtis distance influence your interpretation of site (dis)similarity?

> ***Answer 5a***:  It represents a dissimilarity. What information led to this inference? (i) The values obtained from Q(3) are identical to its corresponding (i,j) is the resemblance matrix (ii) The diagonals of the matrix, where the same two sites are compared, denotes "0". Since we know apriori that these sites would be identical, a value of "0" would indicate that it has least dissimilarity (and "1" would indicate high dissimilarity)  
> ***Answer 5b***: Sorensen's index only produces a presence-absence matrix i.e. incidence data. Thus, irrespective of whether the site has abundance =1 or 10000, the index yields a value of "1", thus giving no weightage to the 1. This is accounted by the Bray-Curtis Index. 

## 4) VISUALIZING BETA-DIVERSITY

### A. Heatmaps

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. define a color palette,
2. define the order of sites in the Doubs River, and
3. use the `levelplot()` function to create a heatmap of fish abundances in the Doubs River.

```{r}
library("viridis")
library("lattice")
# Define Order of Sites
order <- rev(attr(fish.db, "Labels"))
# Plot Heatmap
levelplot(as.matrix(fish.db)[, order], aspect = "iso", col.regions = inferno,
xlab = "Doubs Site", ylab = "Doubs Site", scales = list(cex = 0.5),
main = "Bray-Curtis Distance")# 0 - greatest similarlty, 1- greatest dissimilarity

```

### B.  Cluster Analysis

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. perform a cluster analysis using Ward's Clustering, and
2. plot your cluster analysis (use either `hclust` or `heatmap.2`). 

```{r} 
library("gplots")
# Perform Cluster Analysis
fish.ward <- hclust(fish.db, method = "ward.D2")
# Plot Cluster
par(mar = c(1, 5, 2, 2) + 0.1)
plot(fish.ward, main = "Doubs River Fish: Ward's Clustering",
ylab = "Squared Bray-Curtis Distance")

gplots::heatmap.2(as.matrix(fish), distfun = function(x) vegdist(x, method = "bray"),
hclustfun = function(x) hclust(x, method = "ward.D2"),
col = viridis, trace = "none", density.info = "none")

```

***Question 6***: Based on cluster analyses and the introductory plots that we generated after loading the data, develop an ecological hypothesis for fish diversity the `doubs` data set? 

> ***Answer 6***: The upstream sites represent lower diversity but higher abundance when compared to downstream sites.

### C.  Ordination

### Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA)

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. perform a Principal Coordinates Analysis to visualize beta-diversity
2. calculate the variation explained by the first three axes in your ordination
3. plot the PCoA ordination,
4. label the sites as points using the Doubs River site number, and
5. identify influential species and add species coordinates to PCoA plot.

```{r}
fish.pcoa <- cmdscale(fish.db, eig = TRUE, k = 3)
explainvar1 <- round(fish.pcoa$eig[1] / sum(fish.pcoa$eig), 3) * 100
explainvar2 <- round(fish.pcoa$eig[2] / sum(fish.pcoa$eig), 3) * 100
explainvar3 <- round(fish.pcoa$eig[3] / sum(fish.pcoa$eig), 3) * 100
sum.eig <- sum(explainvar1, explainvar2, explainvar3)

# Define Plot Parameters
par(mar = c(5, 5, 1, 2) + 0.1)
# Initiate Plot
plot(fish.pcoa$points[ ,1], fish.pcoa$points[ ,2], ylim = c(-0.2, 0.7),
xlab = paste("PCoA 1 (", explainvar1, "%)", sep = ""),
ylab = paste("PCoA 2 (", explainvar2, "%)", sep = ""),
pch = 16, cex = 2.0, type = "n", cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.2, axes = FALSE)
# Add Axes
axis(side = 1, labels = T, lwd.ticks = 2, cex.axis = 1.2, las = 1)
axis(side = 2, labels = T, lwd.ticks = 2, cex.axis = 1.2, las = 1)
abline(h = 0, v = 0, lty = 3)
box(lwd = 2)
# Add Points & Labels
points(fish.pcoa$points[ ,1], fish.pcoa$points[ ,2],
pch = 19, cex = 3, bg = "gray", col = "gray")
text(fish.pcoa$points[ ,1], fish.pcoa$points[ ,2],
labels = row.names(fish.pcoa$points))


# First we calculate the relative abundances of each species at each site
fishREL <- fish
for(i in 1:nrow(fish)){
fishREL[i, ] = fish[i, ] / sum(fish[i, ])
}
# Now, we use this information to calculate and add species scores
# install.packages("BiodiversityR")
# install.packages("vegan")
# install.packages("base64enc")
library("indicspecies")
library("base64enc")
library("vegan")
library("BiodiversityR")

fish.pcoa <- add.spec.scores(fish.pcoa,fishREL,method = "pcoa.scores")
text(fish.pcoa$cproj[ ,1], fish.pcoa$cproj[ ,2], labels = row.names(fish.pcoa$cproj), col = "black")
```

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. identify influential species based on correlations along each PCoA axis (use a cutoff of 0.70), and
2. use a permutation test (999 permutations) to test the correlations of each species along each axis.

```{r}
spe.corr <- add.spec.scores(fish.pcoa, fishREL, method = "cor.scores")$cproj
corrcut <- 0.7 # user defined cutoff
imp.spp <- spe.corr[abs(spe.corr[, 1]) >= corrcut | abs(spe.corr[, 2]) >= corrcut, ]
imp.spp #All these species have a correlation >0.7
# Permutation Test for Species Abundances Across Axes
fit <- envfit(fish.pcoa, fishREL, perm = 999)
fit
```

***Question 7***: Address the following questions about the ordination results of the `doubs` data set:

a.  Describe the grouping of sites in the Doubs River based on fish community composition.
b.  Generate a hypothesis about which fish species are potential indicators of river quality.

> ***Answer 7a***:  It appears that sites are grouped according to if they were more likely to be found upstream or downstream. It also appears that the most species in the site largely contribute to the mid/downstream sites 
> ***Answer 7b***:  The following fish (Phph, Neba, Rham, Legi, Cyca, Abbr, Acce, Blbj, Alal, Anan) with correlation > 0.7 are likely to to be potential indicators of river quality. The same can be tested by doing a permutation regression (as in the previous question (Type: fit for results)), where each of these individuals are tested against a NULL generated by random shuffling of BC distance metric (i.e. assumes no underlying distribution) 



## 5) HYPOTHESIS TESTING

### A.  Multivariate Procedures for Categorical Designs
Earlier work done in the Doubs River suggested that the river has four distinct regions of habitat quality: the first region (sites 1-14) of "high quality"; the second (sites 15 - 19) and fourth (sites 26 - 30) of "moderate quality"; and the third  (sites 20 - 25) of "low quality".

In the code chunk below, test the hypothesis that fish community composition varies with river quality.

1. create a factor vector that categorizes habitat quality in the Doubs River,
2. use the multivariate analyses for categorical predictors to describe how fish community structure relates to habitat quality.

```{r}
library("indicspecies")
# Create "Factors" vector
quality <- c(rep("HQ", 13), rep("MQ", 5), rep("LQ", 6), rep("MQ", 5))
# Run PERMANOVA with adonis function
adonis(fish ~ quality, method = "bray", permutations = 999)
indval <- multipatt(fish, cluster = quality, func = "IndVal.g", control = how(nperm=999))
summary(indval)
fish.rel <- decostand(fish, method = "total")
phi <- multipatt(fish.rel, cluster = quality, func = "r.g", control = how(nperm=999))
summary(phi)
```

***Question 8***: Based on the PERMANOVA, IndVal, and phi coefficient analyses, what did you learn about the relationship between habitat quality and the fish species composition?

> ***Answer 8***: PERMANOVA suggests that quality habitat is indeed a predictor of fish abundance (R2 = 0.4, p<0.01). IndVal indicates that a large number of species (20) can be associated with a particular water quality (LQ+MQ), while phi coefficients indicate that species associations with habitat quality are more stringent, where different species group are associated with different status of water quality


### B.  Multivariate Procedures for Continuous Designs

### i.  Mantel Test
In the R code chunk below, do the following:   

1. create distance matrices for both fish communities and environmental factors, and
2. use a Mantel test to determine if these matrices are correlated, and test the hypothesis that fish assemblages are correlated with stream environmental variables.

```{r}
# Define Matrices
fish.dist <- vegdist(doubs$fish[-8, ], method = "bray")
env.dist <- vegdist(scale(doubs$env[-8,]),method = "euclid")
#Mantel Test
mantel(fish.dist,env.dist)
```

***Question 9***: What do the results from our Mantel test suggest about fish diversity and stream environmental conditions? How does this relate to your hypothesis about stream quality influencing fish communities?

> ***Answer 9***:  Mantel test determines that fish assemblages and stream environmental variables are indeed correlated (R2 = 0.6, p < 0.01). It agrees with the initial hypothesis that was set-up, that stream quality is a good predictor of fish communities

### ii.  Constrained Ordination
In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. create an environmental matrix of the water chemistry data included in the `doubs` dataset using forward and reverse selection of variables,
2. conduct a redundancy analysis on the fish assemblages of the Doubs River,
3. use a permutation test to determine the significance of the constrained analysis,
4. use a permutation test to determine the correlation of each environmental factor on the constrained axes,
5. calculate the explained variation on the first and second constrained axes,
6. plot the constrained ordination results including labeled points for each site, and
7. add vectors that demonstrate the influence of each environmental factor the constrained ordination.   

```{r}
# Define environmental matrix
env.chem <- as.matrix(doubs$env[-8 , 5:11])
# Perform dbRDA
doubs.dbrda <- dbrda(fish.db ~ ., as.data.frame(env.chem))
ordiplot(doubs.dbrda)
# First, we will model only the intercept
doubs.dbrda.mod0 <- dbrda(fish.db ~ 1, as.data.frame(env.chem))
# Note there are no vectors here (we didn't constrain anything)
# Therefore, the axes suggest this is a simple MDS (i.e., PCoA)
ordiplot(doubs.dbrda.mod0)
# Next, we will model the full model, with all explanatory variables
doubs.dbrda.mod1 <- dbrda(fish.db ~ ., as.data.frame(env.chem))
# Now we step through all combinations of explanatory variables in our model
# The function returns the model with the lowest AIC value
doubs.dbrda <- ordiR2step(doubs.dbrda.mod0, doubs.dbrda.mod1, perm.max = 200)
# Lets look at the model that was selected
doubs.dbrda$call
doubs.dbrda$anova
ordiplot(doubs.dbrda)
# Permutation tests to evaluate significance
permutest(doubs.dbrda, permutations = 999)
envfit(doubs.dbrda, env.chem[,c(4,6,7)], perm = 999)
# Calculate Explained Variation
dbrda.explainvar1 <- round(doubs.dbrda$CCA$eig[1] /
sum(c(doubs.dbrda$CCA$eig, doubs.dbrda$CA$eig)), 3) * 100
dbrda.explainvar2 <- round(doubs.dbrda$CCA$eig[2] /
sum(c(doubs.dbrda$CCA$eig, doubs.dbrda$CA$eig)), 3) * 100
# Define Plot Parameters
par(mar = c(5, 5, 4, 4) + 0.1)
# Initiate Plot
plot(scores(doubs.dbrda, display = "wa"), xlim = c(-1.3, 1.1), ylim = c(-1.1, 2.7),
xlab = paste("dbRDA 1 (", dbrda.explainvar1, "%)", sep = ""),
ylab = paste("dbRDA 2 (", dbrda.explainvar2, "%)", sep = ""),
pch = 16, cex = 2.0, type = "n", cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.2, axes = FALSE)
# Add Axes
axis(side = 1, labels = T, lwd.ticks = 2, cex.axis = 1.2, las = 1)
axis(side = 2, labels = T, lwd.ticks = 2, cex.axis = 1.2, las = 1)
abline(h = 0, v = 0, lty = 3)
box(lwd = 2)
# Add Points & Labels
points(scores(doubs.dbrda, display = "wa"),
pch = 19, cex = 3, bg = "gray", col = "gray")
text(scores(doubs.dbrda, display = "wa"),
labels = row.names(scores(doubs.dbrda, display = "wa")))
# Add Environmental Vectors
vectors <- scores(doubs.dbrda, display = "bp")
#row.names(vectors) <- rownames(vectors)
arrows(0, 0, vectors[,1], vectors[, 2],
lwd = 2, lty = 1, length = 0.2, col = "red")
text(vectors[,1], vectors[, 2], pos = 3,
labels = row.names(vectors))
axis(side = 3, lwd.ticks=2, cex.axis=1.2, las = 1, col = "red", lwd = 2.2,
at = pretty(range(vectors[, 1])) * 2, labels = pretty(range(vectors[, 1])))
axis(side = 4, lwd.ticks=2, cex.axis=1.2, las = 1, col = "red", lwd = 2.2,
at = pretty(range(vectors[, 2])) * 2, labels = pretty(range(vectors[, 2])))
```

***Question 10***: Based on the constrained ordination, what are the environmental variables (or groups of correlated variables) that seem to be contributing to variation in fish community structure?

> ***Answer 10***: Prior to model selection, we find that pH, har, nit, amm, pho and oxy contribute to variation in fish community, with several of these parameters correlated to each other (eg. pH showing high correlation with all other variables, as indicated by "psych::corr.test(env.chem)" ). Post-model selection, we find that not, bdo and oxy are the primary environmental variables contributing to fish community structure.

### iii. Variation Partitioning
In the code chunk below,   

1. Create a matrix model of the selected environmental variables,
2. Create a matrix model of the selected PCNM axes,
3. Perform constrained and partial constrained ordinations using the spatial and environmental models you just created,
4. Test the significance of each of your constrained ordinations using permutation tests,
5. Partition the variation among sites into the relative importance of space, environment, spatially structured environment, and residuals,
6. Plot the variation partitioning output to visualize it.  
```{r}
# Remember, our environmental model uses oxy, bdo, and nit and has R2 of 0.53
doubs.dbrda$anova
# Let's create a matrix model for our environmental data
env.mod <- model.matrix(~ oxy + bdo + nit, as.data.frame(env.chem))[,-1]
rs <- rowSums(fish)/sum(fish)
# Next, we will perform PCNM
doubs.pcnmw <- pcnm(dist(doubs$xy[-8,]), w = rs, dist.ret = T)
# PCNM can return negative eigenvalues, but only the
# eigenvectors associated with the positive eigenvalues are meaningful
doubs.pcnmw$values > 0
doubs.space <- as.data.frame(scores(doubs.pcnmw))
doubs.pcnm.mod0 <- dbrda(fish.db ~ 1, doubs.space)
doubs.pcnm.mod1 <- dbrda(fish.db ~ ., doubs.space)
step.pcnm <- ordiR2step(doubs.pcnm.mod0, doubs.pcnm.mod1, perm.max = 200)
# Because this is another dbRDA, we could visualize the biplot
# showing how each vector explains variation across sites
plot(step.pcnm)
# The object `step.pcnm` now contains the selected model.
step.pcnm$anova
# We can now construct a spatial model using only the selected PCNM axes.
space.mod <- model.matrix(~ PCNM2 + PCNM3 + PCNM5 + PCNM1 +
PCNM13 + PCNM16 + PCNM6, doubs.space)[,-1]
# First conduct constrained ordinations
doubs.total.env <- dbrda(fish.db ~ env.mod)
doubs.total.space <- dbrda(fish.db ~ space.mod)
# Next construct partial constrained ordinations
doubs.env.cond.space <- dbrda(fish.db ~ env.mod + Condition(space.mod))
doubs.space.cond.env <- dbrda(fish.db ~ space.mod + Condition(env.mod))
# Next test for significance of the dbRDA fractions.
permutest(doubs.env.cond.space, permutations = 999)
permutest(doubs.space.cond.env, permutations = 999)
permutest(doubs.total.env, permutations = 999)
permutest(doubs.total.space, permutations = 999)
# Using the built-in varpart() function
doubs.varpart <- varpart(fish.db, env.mod, space.mod)
doubs.varpart
par(mar = c(2,2,2,2))
plot(doubs.varpart)
text(1, 0.25, "Space")
text(0, 0.25, "Env")
mtext("Variation Partitioning of\nDoubs Fish Diversity", side = 3, line = -3)
```

***Question 11***: Interpret the variation partitioning results.   

> ***Answer 11***: While space explains 24% of variation in fish diversity, environment explains 13% of the diversity and the interaction of the two explains 37% of the variation. Thus, this indicates that fish diversity is most strongly explained by spatially structured environmental variation.

## SYNTHESIS
Load the dataset you are using for your project. Perform an ordination to visualize your dataset.  Using this ordination, develop some hypotheses relevant to $\beta$-diversity and identify the appropriate tools you would use to test them.

> ***Answer SYTHESIS***: The first two axes explain only <10% of the variation in the dataset. Although the analysis indicates that there could be several different indicator species that explain this trend, only three of the species have a correlation of greater thatn 0.7. However, permutation tests indicate that there could be more number of species that could help explain this pattern.Currently, we are working on other categorical variables (eg. Habitat Type) that could help explain the variation in sites (PERMANOVA Analysis) and other ways to categorize the species into various categorical variables.
